Given an array A[] of N integers and an integer X. The task is to find the sum of three integers in A[] such that it is closest to X.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
A[] = {-1 , 2, 1, -4}
X = 1
Output: 2
Explaination: 
Sums of triplets:
(-1) + 2 + 1 = 2
(-1) + 2 + (-4) = -3
2 + 1 + (-4) = -1
2 is closest to 1.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, -5}
X = 10
Output: 9
Explaination: 
Sums of triplets:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
1 + 3 + 4 = 7
...
9 is closest to 10.
