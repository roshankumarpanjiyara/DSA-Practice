Given a positive integer N, return the Nth row of pascal's triangle.
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients formed by summing up the elements of previous row.

Example :
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
For N = 3, return 3rd row i.e 1 2 1

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output: 1 3 3 1
Explanation: 4th row of pascal's triangle
is 1 3 3 1.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 4 6 4 1
Explanation: 5th row of pascal's triangle
is 1 4 6 4 1.
